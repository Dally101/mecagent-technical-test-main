## Technical Journey & Problem-Solving Approach

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment Challenges (HF Spaces + Zero GPU)
**Challenge:** Persistent ContextVar errors with Gradio 4.x and Zero GPU decorators
```
LookupError: <ContextVar name='progress' at 0x7f...>
```

**Strategic Response:**
- Systematically researched Zero GPU best practices and 2024/2025 compatibility updates
- Applied multiple fix strategies: removed `share=True`, updated package versions, simplified GPU function architecture
- Identified fundamental incompatibility between current Gradio versions and Zero GPU context management

**Key Insight:** Sometimes the most productive path is pivoting to alternative infrastructure rather than forcing incompatible technologies to work together.

### Phase 2: Model Architecture Evolution
**Original Plan:** GLM-4.5V (106B parameters, MoE architecture)  
**Reality Check:** Model too advanced for current transformers library support
```
ValueError: model type `glm4v_moe` but Transformers does not recognize this architecture
```

**Solution Strategy:**
- Researched vision-language model landscape for 2024/2025
- Evaluated compatibility matrix: LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2-VL, vs cutting-edge models
- Selected LLaVA-1.5-7B as optimal balance of capability and compatibility

**Technical Rationale:**
- **Proven Architecture:** Mature, well-documented, extensively tested
- **Resource Efficient:** 7B parameters vs 106B (15x reduction)
- **T4 Compatible:** Works within Google Colab's free tier constraints
- **Transformers Native:** Full support in transformers 4.44.1

### Phase 3: Training Pipeline Development

#### CPU Proof-of-Concept
First established local CPU training with DialoGPT-small to validate the data pipeline:
```python
# Successful CPU training metrics:
ðŸ’¡ Trainable: 811,008 (0.65%)
âœ… Training complete! Model saved to ./test-cad-model
```

This proved the fundamental approach was sound and data preprocessing worked correctly.

#### GPU Optimization Strategy
Transitioned to Google Colab with aggressive memory optimization:
- **4-bit quantization** (BitsAndBytesConfig with NF4)
- **LoRA fine-tuning** (r=8, targeting only essential modules)
- **Batch size optimization** (1 sample per batch, 4-step accumulation)
- **Sequence length management** (256 tokens max)

## Key Project Insights

### 1. **Right-Sized Model Selection is Critical**
The project's success hinged on recognizing that bleeding-edge models (GLM-4.5V) aren't always optimal for development environments. LLaVA-1.5 provided the perfect balance:
- **Sufficient Capability:** Proven vision-language understanding
- **Resource Efficiency:** Trainable on free/accessible hardware
- **Ecosystem Maturity:** Full tooling and documentation support

### 2. **Infrastructure Pragmatism Over Theoretical Optimality**
Initially pursued Zero GPU for its cost-effectiveness, but pivoted to Google Colab when compatibility issues emerged. This demonstrated:
- **Time-to-value prioritization:** Working solution > perfect solution
- **Iterative development:** Start with what works, optimize later
- **Resource accessibility:** Free Colab T4 > paid but problematic Zero GPU

### 3. **Memory Optimization as Core Competency**
Successfully reduced memory requirements from 70GB (GLM-4.5V full precision) to <10GB (LLaVA-1.5 quantized):
- **Quantization strategy:** 4-bit NF4 with double quantization
- **LoRA efficiency:** 0.65% trainable parameters
- **Sequence management:** Appropriate length limits

## What I Would Do Differently in Retrospect

### 1. **Earlier Model Compatibility Research**
- Start with transformers compatibility matrix before model selection
- Test model loading in target environment before building full pipeline
- Maintain fallback options for each critical component

### 2. **Incremental Complexity Approach**
- Begin with text-only models before vision-language
- Validate data pipeline with smaller datasets first
- Establish baseline metrics before optimization

### 3. **Environment Diversity Planning**
- Develop for multiple platforms simultaneously (Colab + local + HF)
- Create environment-agnostic configuration systems
- Build docker containers for reproducibility
